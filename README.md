# Final Project - SNHU Travel

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the CS-250-11375-M01 Software Development Lifecycle course at SNHU. The project involves developing an innovative travel booking tool using Agile methodology as a pilot for ChadaTech. This repository includes the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverables, as well as the answers to essential questions for the Computer Science program.

## Essential Questions

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs involves gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders and understanding their expectations. Creating user stories helps translate these needs into actionable tasks by focusing on what the user wants to achieve, thus guiding the development process towards meeting these goals effectively.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach developing programs by breaking down the project into manageable tasks and iteratively working on them. Agile processes such as Scrum, which include sprints, daily stand-ups, and continuous feedback, help in maintaining flexibility and ensuring the project stays aligned with user needs.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member means actively contributing to the team's goals, communicating effectively, and being open to feedback. It also involves collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, and supporting teammates to overcome challenges and achieve project success.

## Project Summary

### Applying Roles
During the SNHU Travel project, each member of our Scrum-Agile team played a vital role in our success. As the Scrum Master, my main job was to facilitate Scrum events and ensure the team worked efficiently. I organized and ran Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Backlog Refinement, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective meetings. This structured approach helped us maintain high standards and continuously improve.

### Completing User Stories
The Scrum-Agile approach helped us complete our user stories through iterative development and continuous feedback. For instance, the user story "As a cost-conscious user, I want to set a price limit so that I can find travel options within my budget" was developed, tested, and refined through collaboration and feedback loops. Regular Sprint Reviews allowed us to showcase our progress to stakeholders, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments.

### Handling Interruptions
Agile's flexibility was crucial when managing project interruptions and changes in direction. During the SNHU Travel project, we faced a significant change when the client requested a shift from "Top 5 Destinations" to "Top 5 Detox/Wellness Destinations." We managed this change efficiently through our daily stand-ups and sprint reviews. Regular communication ensured all team members were aware of the change and could coordinate their efforts to deliver the updated feature promptly.

### Communication
Effective communication was key to our success. Regular meetings such as Daily Stand-ups provided a platform for team members to share updates, discuss obstacles, and plan their day. In addition to verbal communication, we used collaborative tools like JIRA and Slack for task tracking and quick communication. This proactive approach to communication fostered collaboration and kept everyone aligned with project goals.

### Organizational Tools
Organizational tools and Scrum-Agile principles played a vital role in our success. Tools like JIRA and Smartsheet helped us track tasks, collaborate, and monitor progress. These tools provided real-time updates on project status, allowing us to identify bottlenecks and adjust our plans accordingly. Scrum events such as Sprint Planning and Sprint Retrospectives were instrumental in keeping the team aligned and continuously improving.

### Evaluating Agile Process
The Scrum-Agile approach had several advantages during the SNHU Travel project. It provided flexibility, allowing us to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently. The iterative development process ensured continuous feedback and alignment with user needs, resulting in a product that met client expectations. Regular communication and collaboration fostered a cohesive team environment, enhancing productivity and quality. However, there were also challenges. Managing scope and prioritizing tasks required careful planning and constant reassessment. Despite these challenges, the benefits of Agile, such as flexibility and responsiveness, outweighed the drawbacks.
